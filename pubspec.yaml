# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

# To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    # - assets/images/logo.png
    # - assets/images/uno_onboarding.png
    # - assets/images/dos_onboarding.png
    # - assets/images/tres_onboarding.png
    # - assets/images/proyecto_uno.png
    # - assets/images/proyecto_dos.png
    # - assets/images/proyecto_tres.png
    # - assets/images/uno_img.png
    # - assets/images/dos_img.png
    # - assets/images/tres_img.png
    # - assets/images/logo_email.png
    # - assets/images/logo_login.png


    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf
          weight: 400

    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Light.ttf
          weight: 400
